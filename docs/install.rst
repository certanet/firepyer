Installing Firepyer
===================

The latest release is available to download from PyPI, simply using ``pip install firepyer``.

Alternatively, as this project is still in early development, the best place to get the most recent features is directly from the `source GitHub repo <https://github.com/certanet/firepyer/>`_.
